# A day in the life of Johannes Kepler


[Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler){:target="_blank"}
was a Germann astronomer and mathematician.
Upon [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe){:target="_blank"}'s death,
Kepler inherited the meticulously collected astronomical observations made by Brahe,
as well as Brahe's position as *Imperial Mathematician* to the Habsburg Emperor in 1601.


With the detailed observations made by Brahe,
Kepler was able to formulate his **third law of planetary motion**.
It says that the time it takes a planet to complete a full orbit around the sun is
proportional to the average distance of the planet to the sun raised to some power.
To express this statement using a formula,
we will use the following letters.
<div>
  \[\begin{aligned}
    D\ &=\ \text{average distance to the sun}\\
    T\ &=\ \text{time to orbit the sun}
  \end{aligned}\]
</div>

Kepler proposed there are some constants
$k$ and $p$ so that $T = k\cdot D^p$.


Kepler had access to the following information.

| Planet  | Average distance to sun (AU) | Days to complete one orbit |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------|
| Mercury |             0.389            |             87.77          |
| Venus   |             0.724            |            224.70          |
| Earth   |             1                |            365.25          |
| Mars    |             1.524            |            686.95          |
| Jupiter |             5.200            |           4332.62          |
| Saturn  |             9.510            |           10759.2          |

 - Using this information, estimate $p$.

 - Kepler's third law actually claims that $p$ is some nice fraction. Can you guess this fraction?
