# Homework Assignments on Desmos Graphing Calculator - HW-3, HW-4, HW-5








## HW-3

 - Create a folder called `HW-3` within `0-Homework-Assignments`.
 - Use Sublime Text to save files called
   `anvil.txt`, `orbits.txt`, and `kepler.txt` within `HW-3`,
   that is, within the folder whose path is
   `/Users/YOUR_NAME/Documents/UCLA-Classes/PIC-1/0-Homework-Assignments/HW-3`.
 - After following the instructions below,
   submit `anvil.txt`, `orbits.txt`, and `kepler.txt` to Gradescope.




### `anvil.txt`

In addition to working on the [exercise](2-3a-anvil.md),
speak to two other students in the class about your conclusions.
Did they reach the same conclusion as you?
If not, do you think
you are correct or they are correct,
or can you not say?
If you cannot say,
why do you think this is?

In `anvil.txt`, share...
 - the center of your image;
 - the $a$, $b$, and $c$ that Desmos learned for you;
 - your answer to the exercise;
 - your answers to the questions above.

Here is how you might start filling in `anvil.txt`.

```
The value I am using for the center of the image is

In my solution Desmos learns
    a = 
    b = 
    c = 

My answer to the question "Is everyone safe on the street below?!" is "".

Upon discussing the exercise with two other students in the class I found
```




### `orbits.txt`

Work on the [exercise](2-3b-orbit.md).
In `orbits.txt`,
share the values that your Desmos learned
for $r_{saturn}$ and $r_{earth}$,
and the value that your Desmos
calculated for $\frac{r_{saturn}}{r_{earth}}$.

```
            r_{saturn} = 
             r_{earth} = 
r_{saturn} / r_{earth} = 
```




### `kepler.txt`

Work on the [exercise](2-3c-kepler.md).
In `kepler.txt`,
share the values that your Desmos learned for
$p$ and the value you guessed for the nice fractional value of $p$.

```
Desmos learn p as 

I think Kepler's law says p is 
```








## HW-4

 - Work on the [marriage of cookies exercise](2-3d-cookie.md).
 - Create a folder called `HW-4` within `0-Homework-Assignments`.
 - Use Sublime Text to save a file called `cookie.txt` within `HW-4`,
   that is, within the folder whose path is
   `/Users/YOUR_NAME/Documents/UCLA-Classes/PIC-1/0-Homework-Assignments/HW-4`.
 - In `cookie.txt` answer the following question.
   > Why did the one part of the exercise suggest to overestimate the size of the original cookie and underestimate the amount left?
 - Save a screenshot of your Desmos solution to the same folder and rename it as `cookie.png`.
   You might have to look up how to take a screenshot!
 - Submit `cookie.txt` and `cookie.png` to Gradescope.








## HW-5

 - Work on the [rings of Saturn exercise](2-3e-rings.md).
 - Create a folder called `HW-5` within `0-Homework-Assignments`.
 - Use Sublime Text to save a file called `rings.txt` within `HW-5`,
   that is, within the folder whose path is
   `/Users/YOUR_NAME/Documents/UCLA-Classes/PIC-1/0-Homework-Assignments/HW-5`.
 - In `rings.txt` specify whether you used the first or second image
   and submit the $r$ values that you and Desmos calculated.

```
I used the  image.

Desmos and I calculated...
           r_{saturn} = 
             r_{ring} = 
r_{saturn} / r_{ring} = 

```

 - Submit `rings.txt` to Gradescope.
 - **REMARK.** The [tilt of Saturn exercise](2-3f-tilt.md) is a bonus exercise.
   Solving it is rewarding, but it will not give you extra course credit.
